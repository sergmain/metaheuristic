2. rebuild angular in repository metaheuristic-angular
!!! default repo for 2.x. command is metaheuristic-angular

2.1. run command "build4.2 ng build --aot --configuration production-standalone"
2.2. delete dir ./appdirectory/metaheuristic
2.3. delete dir ./appdirectory/mh-angular
!!! do not delete files in ./appdirectory

2.4. copy dir ./dist/mh-angular to ./appdirectory
!!! as a result there must be a dir ./appdirectory/mh-angular

2.5. copy dir ./distrib/jpackage/output/metaheuristic (in repository metaheuristic ) to ./appdirectory
!!! as a result there must be a dir ./appdirectory/metaheuristic

2.6. delete everything in ./release-builds
2.7. run command "electron-packager"
