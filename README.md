For commercial use you must buy a commercial annual subscription if needed:

| Type of customer (Org or personal)                                         | Conditions of using   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Personal use                                                               | Free to use           |  
| Commercial usage in company owned up to 2 persons\*                        | Free to use           |  
| Scientific researches                                                      | Free to use\*\*\*\*   |  
| Non-profit organizations                                                   | Free to use           |  
| Commercial usage without MHBP, less than 25 Processors\*\*                 | Free to use           | 
| Commercial usage with MHBP\*\*\*\*\*, one instance of DB per account\*\*\* | Free to use           | 

\* Ownership of company must be directed, ownership via any kind of proxy company is prohibited.  
\*\* Processors are client parts of metaheuristic which are processing tasks.
One instance of Metaheuristic can handle multiply Processors.   
\*\*\* instance of DB is an installation of database in OS, not a scheme or database in term of DLL.
I.e. - if you want to use multi-tenant option and host all your companies and users in one installation of DB, you have to buy subscription.
Accounts in Main company (ID #1) are excluded from counting.  
\*\*\*\* Citing isn't required but we will be glad if you cite Metaheuristic in your paper.
\*\*\*\*\* usage of MHBP is an usage of Evaluation or/and Scenario 

Commercial usage
All other cases (i.e. there are 25 Processors\*\* or more, multi-tenant/multi user installation,
commercial support, usage of MHBP's Evaluation or/and Scenario, other cases):
- Annual subscription
   - $25k for Dispatcher\*\*\*
   - $500 per Processor
   - $1200 per User\*


\* User is person with distinctive account in db. If person has 2 accounts this is calculated as 2 Users.
Accounts in Main company (ID #1) are excluded from counting.
\*\* Processors are client parts of metaheuristic which are processing tasks.
One instance of Metaheuristic can handle multiply Processors. For using MHBP only, Processors aren't needed.   
\*\*\* Dispatcher is a server part of metaheuristic which is serving all configurations
and managing the process of assigning tasks to Processors.

If you need a commercial support, it can be bought at the same price as for Commercial usage.
